Execute app.py to run the Streamflow visualization.
app.py uses data from two different dataframes, one of which is pulled directly from the github repo, but the other, 'all80.csv', needs to be in the same folder as app.py for the code to load in the data.
The visualization is generated and run on http://127.0.0.1:8050, which can be opened in any browser
