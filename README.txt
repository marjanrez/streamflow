1. Execute app.py in terminal to run the Streamflow visualization.
2. app.py uses data from two different dataframes i.e. csv files, one of which, 'newStream.csv' is pulled directly from the github repo, but the other, 'all80.csv', needs to be in the same folder as app.py for the code to load in the data.
3. all80.csv was too big, over 100MB, to be uploaded into the github repository. In order to download 'all80.csv', navigate to the 'releases' section of the repository and download file directly into local machine.
4. The visualization is generated and run on http://127.0.0.1:8050, which can be opened in any browser
5. All interactions can be performed on the visualization in a browser
